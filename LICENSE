   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. You just DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.
  1. This license was originally WTFPL, but according to discussions on Reddit, its naming isn't considered very polite, leading to avoidance of software using this license (e.g., https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/r75pe0/do_what_the_fck_you_want_to_public_license/). Therefore, please use this license name so that everyone can use it.
