  0. You just DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.
  1. This custom license was created to provide maximum freedom, similar to WTFPL, but with a more polite naming convention to encourage broader adoption and avoid the negative connotations associated with the original WTFPL's phrasing (as discussed on platforms like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/r75pe0/do_what_the_fck_you_want_to_public_license/)).
